				<td><p>Hidden Stone Village, literally meaning: Village Hidden by Rocks is the hidden village of the Land of Earth.<br> As the village of one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries, Iwagakure has a Kage as its leader known as the Tsuchikage, of which there have been four in its history. <br>The rocky mountain ranges that surround the village provide a natural stronghold that it is very proud of. <br>The village's infrastructure is built from much of the surrounding rock and stone, shaped into tower-like structures that are inter-connected by a network of bridges. <br>The Tsuchikage's residence seems to be the tallest structure with a cone-shaped roof and bears the kanji for "Earth" (土, Tsuchi) on it.
<br><br>
The standard attire for Iwa shinobi consists of red outfit — which can either have one, or both sleeves — a lapel which is usually found on the side without a sleeve and a brown flak jacket — which also may, or may not have a pouch attached to it. <br>They also tend to wear mesh armour around their ankles. <br>Many Iwagakure ninja use Earth Release techniques. <br>Iwagakure is well-known for the rock-hard attitude of its shinobi; as soon as the Tsuchikage gives an order, the Iwa-nin follow it without hesitation, even if it means death.</p></td>
