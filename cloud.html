				<td><p>Hidden Cloud Village, literally meaning: Village Hidden by Clouds) is the hidden village of the Land of Lightning and was founded by the First Raikage. <br>As the village of one of the Five Great Shinobi Countries, Kumogakure has a Kage as its leader known as the Raikage, of which there have been five in its history. <br>The village is located in a range of tall mountains, and is literally hidden in the clouds. <br>The Raikage works in a large blue structure built into the tallest mountain.
<br><br>
The standard attire for Kumo shinobi consists of a long, grey top which gathers just at the waist to give a sash-like appearance, with a matching coloured bottom. <br>Over this they wear white, one-strapped flak jackets and arm as well as shin-guards. <br>Many Kumogakure ninja use Lightning Release techniques.</p></td>
